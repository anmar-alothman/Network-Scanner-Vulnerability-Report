# Network Scanner & Vulnerability Report

A network scanning tool that identifies open ports and vulnerabilities on devices within a local network. This tool provides valuable insights into the security posture of your network and generates a comprehensive vulnerability report.

## Features

- Scans the local network for devices and identifies open ports.
- Performs software and operating system version scanning on the identified devices.
- Retrieves known vulnerabilities related to the operating system and open ports.
- Generates a detailed vulnerability report.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages: `socket`, `subprocess`, `sys`, `datetime`, `tqdm`, `requests`

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/network-scanner.git](https://github.com/anmar-alothman/Network-Scanner-Vulnerability-Report.git)
Navigate to the repository's directory:
shell
Copy code
cd network-scanner
Run the scanner by providing the IP address or network prefix as an argument:
shell
Copy code
python scanner.py <IP address or network prefix>
Example:
shell
Copy code
python scanner.py 192.178.92.0/24
The tool will start scanning the devices within the specified network. It will identify open ports and perform software and OS version scanning.
Once the scanning is complete, the tool will generate a vulnerability report, highlighting known vulnerabilities related to the operating system and open ports on each device.
Review the generated vulnerability report to assess the security posture of your network.
